Zombie Survival 2 is a SourceMod plugin for Team Fortress 2 that features all-class action with multiple modes, inspired by the Left 4 Dead series. It comes with support for a wealth of official and custom maps available through JSON files, which any server owner can make themselves for other maps. Plugin contributors are listed in the [player manual](https://zombie-survival-2.github.io/index.html) accessible through the in-game MOTD.

To find a server running Zombie Survival 2, open Team Fortress 2, click **Find A Game** and then **Community Servers**. In the browser that opens, type in the tag `zs2`, then click **Refresh all**.
